## Car-Insurance-Modelling-using-Python

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates the development and implementation of a Poisson Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for predicting the frequency of insurance claims. The model leverages driver demographics, vehicle attributes, and regional factors to estimate claim likelihood.

## Project Objectives

- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop a robust predictive model using Poisson GLM to forecast insurance claim frequency.
- **Feature Engineering:** Explore and engineer relevant features from the dataset to enhance model accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate statistical metrics and visualizations.
- **Colab Integration:** Demonstrate the seamless execution of the analysis within the Google Colab environment.

## Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   - The project utilizes a sample insurance claims dataset. (Replace with actual dataset details if applicable).
   - Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, one-hot encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Comprehensive EDA is performed to understand data distributions, identify potential outliers, and uncover relationships between variables.
   - Visualizations are employed to facilitate data exploration and gain insights.

3. **Model Development:**
   - A Poisson GLM is selected as the predictive model due to its suitability for count data.
   - The `statsmodels` library is used for model implementation and parameter estimation.

4. **Model Evaluation and Validation:**
   - The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as deviance, AIC, and pseudo-R-squared.
   - Cross-validation techniques may be applied to assess model generalization and robustness.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy:** Numerical computing library.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **Statsmodels:** Statistical modeling library for GLM implementation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Data visualization libraries.
- **Google Colab:** Cloud-based platform for interactive notebook execution.
